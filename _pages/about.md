I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing dual degrees in Electronics Information Engineering at the **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)** and Electronics and Electrical Engineering at the **University of Glasgow**. My research interests lie in large models, industrial fault diagnosis, radar sensing and medical signal processing, with a focus on the application of deep learning in these fields. I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Zhiliang Liu at UESTC for my research on industrial fault diagnosis and by Prof. Shisheng Guo at UESTC for my work on radar and biomedical signal processing. I am dedicated to exploring how AI technology can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of systems in real world applications. 

Beyond academics, I have a strong interest in classical music, particularly piano music, and I served as the President of the Piano Association at UESTC. I also enjoy exploring new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements. In my free time, I like to engage in outdoor activities, such as hiking, to relax and recharge.
